# Pixel Art Maker Project

This is project I've created for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.
This project was created from a starter code repo that contained the basic HTML. The background and music added are my own and I've written all the JS for this project.
This project was created using HTML||CSS||JS

Here is a live link to the project [project](https://michellelanecode.github.io/Pix-Art-Maker/);
